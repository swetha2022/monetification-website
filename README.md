In our project, we aim to convert real-life photographs into impressionist art similar to Claude Monetâ€™s work. We will work with core graphics pipeline techniques, such as rasterization, image sampling, and texture mapping to break down photographs into their pixel components and simulate impressionistic art and color blending when rendering the scene.
